# AI Data Preprocessing & Modeling with Scikit-learn

ðŸš€ This project demonstrates basic AI model building using Scikit-learn and Pandas.  
The aim is to showcase the process of data preprocessing and training classification models like Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Tasks Performed

### âœ… Task 1: Data Preprocessing
- Loaded a dataset (Breast Cancer from sklearn)
- Checked for missing values
- Normalized the features using `StandardScaler`
- Split data into training and testing sets

### âœ… Task 2: Machine Learning Modeling
- Trained and evaluated:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Logistic Regression Model
- Compared model accuracies

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model                | Accuracy        |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Decision Tree        | ~0.93           |
| Logistic Regression  | ~0.96           |

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Modeling_Project.git
cd AI_Modeling_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code step-by-step.
